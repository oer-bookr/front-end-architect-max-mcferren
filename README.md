## **Project Description**

For the last 4 weeks, I have been studying React and how to build a CRUD API. For this build week project, I worked with a team including UI developers, a Back End Engineer and a SCRUM Master. Our project is a simple app where users can log in to see a list of open source books and leave a review.

## **Tooling:**
Beyond React fundamentals, this app utilizes Redux, Redux Thunk / Logger Middleware, Axios, Router, Styled Components, and was built and deployed using Netlify.
